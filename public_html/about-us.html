Indian landscape, carry the Mittal mark with them.<br>
Because we recognise the fast pace - the "want it all attitude" and
that's why <br>we never shy away from delivering you the best!  This journey began back in...</b><br><br>

The 1950's<br>
In the age of "pagadi" (tenancy) - Mittal Builders were amongst the first to<br>
form an enterprise that aim to provide, <b>housing for sale</b> in India.<br>
Hence, for the first time in India - the concept of property investment for both<br>
residential and commercial purposes was introduced.
<br>
<b>Mittal Group</b> has revamped the face of the Indian landscape - executing path-breaking<br>
designs, quality structures, innovative functionalities and many world-class centres.<br><br>

Responsible for giving the Indian business community a global presence,<br>
the Mittal Group was the first to develop Nariman Point - Mumbai's famous business<br>
district. Also known as the "Manhattan of India" - today, it's the costliest real estate in the country.<br>
Being India's premier construction house, we carry with us the foresight & the legacy of<br>
many such firsts in Indian construction scenario. One of them being in the 1970s<br>
- with the introduction of a <b>"Township Concept"</b>.<br><br>

Arising from the foresight that major Indian cities will be overpopulated soon,<br>
we created Mini Townships. First of which were implemented in Mumbai, Thane and<br>
Brindavan. Owing to their huge success - this concept was re-created for the other<br>
cities of the country. Today, these townships have the best of amenities and facilities<br>
                            in the world - creating <b>cities within cities,</b> a concept that is a byword across India now.<br><br>
    In the 1990s, <br>Mittal Universal paved the way for the <b>Mill Redevelopment Project</b> in Mumbai. <br>Being the first builders to take up the modernisation of the old cotton mills, <br>that once dotted the landscape of Mumbai. <br>We built the Phoenix Towers and ushered a new wave of growth!

                           <br><br>

The monogram has been derived from the “TT” presents in the original Mittal logo.<br>
Signifying that, even though we’re a new brand with a contemporary outlook,<br>
we never  underestimate the value of relationships already built.<br>
The logo is constructed using four “T's”, reinstating our tagline “Building on Trust”<br>
- the words that we live by and will always wish to achieve.
